## Steps

1. **Check branch name.** Verify current branch matches `feat/nowelizacja-*` pattern. Extract the year and article number from the name.

2. **Show diff summary.** Run `git diff main..HEAD --stat` to list files changed and lines added/removed.

3. **Show commit history.** Run `git log main..HEAD --oneline` to list commits on this branch.

4. **Parse the amendment.** Read the relevant chapter module to identify:
   - Which validation function(s) were added/modified
   - Which articles are referenced (from `article=` params and docstrings)
   - The Polish title of the amendment (from the docstring)
